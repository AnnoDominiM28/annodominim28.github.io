    Koan 6: Nothing Goes Away <br>
  </font>
  For Koan 6, I have chosen to give an explanation of the Internet Archive, functioning as a blog post.<br>
  Koan 6 focuses on how nothing ever truly goes away. The Internet Archive is a good example of this, more specifically the WayBack Machine. The goal of the website is to archive as much data as possible. <br>
  In addition to the Internet Archive, the WayBack Machine's goal is to archive every website at every point of its lifespan. This website is a good example of how nothing truly goes away. <br>
