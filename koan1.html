    Koan 1: It's All Just Bits <br>
  </font>
  For Koan 1, I have chosen to describe an image, more specifically a frame of an episode of Spongebob..<br>
  Videos are just several images, or frames, played closely after each other to create the illusion of animation. This image is one such frame. <br>
  Just like how every piece of data or software is comprised of several bits, each video is comprised of several frames.<br>
