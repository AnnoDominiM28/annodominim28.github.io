    Koan 5: More of the Same Can Be New <br>
  </font>
  For Koan 5, I have chosen to create an image of the Sierpinski Triangle.<br>
  It appears to be an image of one singular triangle initially, however as you inspect further you will find it is made of increasingly smaller and smaller triangles.<br>
  I find this to be a good demonstration of this Koan, as three of the same triangle can join together and form a new, larger triangle. <br>
