    Koan 2: Perfection is Normal <br>
  </font>
  For Koan 2, I have chosen to demonstrate and compare a situation whereas perfection is normal.<br>
  Watch the two provided videos below. In the first video I solve a Rubik's Cube, and the end result is a perfectly solved cube. <br>
  In the second video, however, something is wrong. A corner is twisted. This sort of imperfection is abnormal when solving a Cube This makes it a good demonstration of Koan 2.<br>
